  In the provided code, the function `goto` is implemented to compute the closure of a given set of items when a certain symbol is seen (i.e., moved over). However, it looks like I might not have clearly explained the role and implementation of `aux` and the `goto` function.

Let's correct and clarify this part of the implementation. The `goto` function should handle transitions from one set of items (state) to another set of items (new state) based on the next symbol after the dot in the items.

### Correct Implementation of `goto` and `closure`

Here's the corrected version of the `goto` and `closure` functions along with the `aux` helper function for `closure`:

```ocaml
(* Closure function *)
let closure items =
  let rec aux items seen =
    let new_items = List.fold_left (fun acc item ->
      match List.nth_opt item.rhs item.dot with
      | Some (Nonterminal nt) ->
          List.fold_left (fun acc prod ->
            if prod.lhs = nt && not (List.mem {lhs=prod.lhs; rhs=prod.rhs; dot=0} seen) then
              {lhs=prod.lhs; rhs=prod.rhs; dot=0} :: acc
            else
              acc
          ) acc productions
      | _ -> acc
    ) [] items in
    let items = List.sort_uniq compare (items @ new_items) in
    if List.length items > List.length seen then
      aux items items
    else
      items
  in
  aux items []

(* Goto function *)
let goto items symbol =
  let moved_items = List.fold_left (fun acc item ->
    match List.nth_opt item.rhs item.dot with
    | Some s when s = symbol -> {item with dot = item.dot + 1} :: acc
    | _ -> acc
  ) [] items in
  closure moved_items
```

### Explanation

- **closure**: Computes the closure of a set of items. The `aux` function recursively adds new items to the closure whenever a non-terminal after the dot is encountered. This means if we have an item like `A -> α . B β` and `B -> γ` is a production, then `B -> . γ` will be added to the closure.

- **goto**: Computes the set of items that can be reached from a given set of items after seeing a particular symbol. It first shifts the dot over the given symbol for items where the symbol immediately after the dot matches the given symbol. Then it computes the closure of the resulting items.

### Full Implementation

Now, here is the complete OCaml implementation for the LR(0) parser, combining the above corrections with the rest of the code:

```ocaml
type symbol = Terminal of string | Nonterminal of string

type production = {
  lhs: string;
  rhs: symbol list;
}

type item = {
  lhs: string;
  rhs: symbol list;
  dot: int; (* position of the dot *)
}

type state = item list

type action =
  | Shift of int
  | Reduce of int
  | Accept
  | Error

type parsing_table = {
  action: (int * string, action) Hashtbl.t;
  goto: (int * string, int) Hashtbl.t;
}

  {lhs = "T"; rhs = [Nonterminal "T"; Terminal "*"; Nonterminal "F"]};

          List.fold_left (fun acc prod ->
            if prod.lhs = nt && not (List.mem {lhs=prod.lhs; rhs=prod.rhs; dot=0} seen) then
              {lhs=prod.lhs; rhs=prod.rhs; dot=0} :: acc
